<p>Nature is the physical and material world of the universal. One of the reasons why I love being out in the nature is because I really love what it has to offer especially in Colorado. Colorado is a state that is covered in the beauty of  nature, alomost everywhere you go outside of Denver, you'll see beatuiful landscapes such as mountains covered in beautiful trees, you'll see mountains covered in snow, and beautiful rivers sitting beneath the mountains. The four different seasons that really beautify the trees, especially in the fall and spring where the trees are covered in different colors and really fill the air with beautiful scent and give people a happy feeling.Nature brings its beauty out especially in the summer, when the birds come back to surrond it and give it that chiping noise that really help the nature neighborhood. The state of nature can take your breath away just by one glance. Nature also allows you to do many different activities such as hiking or snowboard and many different activities.</p>

<p> Beach is a area that has sand and body of ocean water on a shore. The reason why I love going the the beach is because when I am sitting the beach and playing with the sand, I feel relaxed and it makes me happy. Beach is a place to enjoy yourself or family gatherings. The beach is a cool place to go to even to just enjoy your summer or if you have nothing you do and are a looking for a place to go to, you have the option to go there and enjoy the water and beautiful scenery. </p>
