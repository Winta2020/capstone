The pond is formed by an earthen dam which backs up Carlton Brook.  The area was acquired by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1966 to protect the waterfowl and other wildlife associated with this area in Central Maine.\r\n<p>The original dam at Carlton Pond was a rock structure built in 1850 to provide water power for a sawmill operation.  In 1972, the Fish and Wildlife Service reconstructed the dam to maintain the integrity of the structure and to assure continued maintenance of the open water, marsh, and wetland areas created by the original dam.  A natural overflow near the structure provides an additional escape route for high water thereby affording extra protection for the dam and control structures.  A right-of-way provides access to the dam for maintenance and public use.\r\n<p>Carlton Pond is one of the few areas in the state which provides nesting habitat for black terns, which are on the endangered species list maintained by the State of Maine.  State and federal non-game biologists and researchers have been monitoring black tern use of Carlton Pond WPA and other areas for several years in an attempt to better determine the species' population status.\r\n<p>Carlton Pond WPA has historically provided good nesting habitat for waterfowl and other birds. To date, 33 bird species have been observed using refuge lands and waters.  Many bird species that use Carlton Pond have been listed by the Partners-in-Flight organization as species that are declining.  Slender Blue Flag, a species listed as Threatened by the State of Maine, has been sighted at Carlton Pond.",

            "RecAreaDescription": "Between 1972 and 1980, the refuges in the Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge were established for the protection of migratory birds, principally colonial nesting seabirds. Containing 48 offshore islands and three mainland units, the refuge totals more than 8,100 acres. The Complex spans over 250 miles of Maine coastline and includes five national wildlife \r\n\r\n\trefuges - Petit Manan, Cross Island, Franklin Island, Seal Island, and Pond Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Service's primary focus at Maine Coastal Islands National Wildlife Refuge is colonial seabird restoration and management.  Refuge islands provide nesting habitat for common, Arctic, and endangered roseate terns, Atlantic puffins, razorbills, black guillemots, Leach's storm-petrels, laughing gulls, and common eiders.  During the last 25 years, the Service and its conservation partners have worked to reverse the decline in these birds' populations.  As a result, many species have returned to islands where they nested historically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to seabirds, wading birds and bald eagles nest on refuge islands.  The mainland divisions provide habitat for songbirds, shorebirds, and waterfowl, as well as opportunities for bird watching and hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe refuge's four mainland properties are located in Hancock and Washington counties.  Upland areas are characterized by spruce-fir forests with some mixed hardwoods.  The 2,195-acre Petit Manan Point Division, in Steuben, also includes jack pine stands, coastal raised heath peatlands, blueberry barrens, old hayfields, freshwater and salt water marshes, cedar swamps, granite shores, and cobble beaches. During the fall migration, 80-acre Cranberry Flowage is filled with over 4,000 ducks. Black ducks, green-winged teal, and mallards rest and feed there on wild rice before migrating south.  The Gouldsboro Bay Division, in Gouldsboro, protects 600 acres, including a large tidal salt marsh and mud flat.  The 1,028-acre Sawyer's Marsh Division lies at the head of a broad salt marsh in Milbridge, just north of Petit Manan Point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn 2005, the refuge acquired the 430 acre Corea Heath Division.

Scattered along 50 miles of coastline in York and Cumberland counties, the refuge consists of ten divisions between Kittery and Cape Elizabeth.  It will contain approximately 7,600 acres when land acquisition is complete.\n\n\n\nOur namesake, Rachel Carson, was a world-renowned marine biologist, author and environmentalist.  She served as an aquatic\n\nbiologist and Editor-in-Chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  During her tenure, she composed a series\n\nof articles on Atlantic Coast wildlife refuges.  \n\n\n\nMs. Carson was born in Pennsylvania in 1907.  Though the mystery of the sea and its creatures captivated her at an early age, the Maine coast particularly inspired her.  Beginning in 1952, she summered on Southport Island, where she studied its beach and tide pools to research The Edge of the Sea (1955). \n\n\n\nThrough tireless investigation for her greatest work, Silent Spring (1962), she linked the unrestrained use of post-World War II chemical pesticides with fearsome, biological consequences.  Overcoming industry and government pressure to abandon her research, she persevered.  Carson simply and convincingly explained the connections between humans and all creatures of the Earth.  She alerted generations to use chemicals with\n\nutmost caution, warning that their improper use has dreadful effects on public health and the environment.  \n\n\n\nRachel Carson died in 1964, a victim of cancer.  As fitting recognition of her tireless work, this refuge, first known as the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge, was renamed in her honor on October 28, 1969 and formally dedicated June 27, 1970.",

The refuge was established in 1988 to ensure the ecological integrity of the Sunkhaze Meadows peat bog and the continued availability of its wetland, stream, forest and wildlife resources to the citizens of the United States.  The purpose of acquisition, under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 was \"... for the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources ...\" and \"... for the benefit of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in performing its activities and services.  Such acceptance may be subject to the terms of any restrictive or affirmative covenant, or condition of servitude  . . . \"  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was the source of funding for the purchase\n\n\n\nThe refuge protects the second-largest and most unique peatland in Maine.  It contains several raised bogs or domes, separated from each other by extensive areas of streamside meadows.  Sunkhaze Stream bisects the refuge along a northeast to southwest orientation and, with its six tributaries, creates a diversity of wetland communities.  The bog and stream wetlands, along with the adjacent uplands and associated transition zones, provide important habitat for many wildlife species.  The wetland complex consists primarily of wet meadows, shrub thickets, cedar swamps, extensive red and silver maple floodplain forests and open freshwater stream habitats, along with those plant communities associated with peatlands such as shrub heaths and cedar and spruce bogs.\n\n\n\nSunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Refuge provides habitat for three plants, seven birds, two mollusks and three invertebrates listed as Endangered or Threatened by the State of Maine.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990's, the Benton and Sandy Stream Divisions were added to the refuge under the auspices of the 1990 Farm Bill.  These small areas are respectively located in the towns of Benton and Unity, Maine.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Maine. In 1970 the Moosehorn Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System.\r\n<p>Every year thousands of migratory birds hitch a ride on the Eastern (Atlantic) Flyway, which spans the skies from Maine to Florida. At the northernmost end of the route, many disembark at 23,000-acre Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge. Although trees in this region have been significantly logged in the past, today a diverse forest stands here, a woodland of aspen, maple, birch, spruce, and fir with scattered stands of white pine. Once scoured heavily by glaciers, the land of the refuge is primarily low, rolling hills dotted with many lakes, bogs, marshes, streams, and rocky outcroppings. \r\nEstablished in 1937, Moosehorn is the only refuge where people study and manage the American woodcock, a reclusive bird that hides in dense cover of young forests during the day, feeds in clearings at night, and flies an amazing courtship ritual in spring. Bald eagles frequent the refuge, and black bears and white-tailed deer are common. In November, deer hunting is allowed. Despite the name, moose are not as common as you would expect. Ducks, geese, and loons congregate on more than 50 lakes. \r\n\r\nThe Wilderness is divided into two units: Edmunds and Birch Islands, both on the rocky Maine coast. \r\n\r\nAlong the several miles of coast of the Edmunds Unit, 24-foot tidal fluctuations are normal, but only the island portion of the Wilderness is affected. A loop road passes along the boundary of the inland Wilderness, and several old roads give miles of access to the area. Off the old roads, bushwhacking through heavy brush can be a nightmare. \r\n\r\nSee also the separately designated Moosehorn (Baring Unit) Wilderness.",
