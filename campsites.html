  <p>The state of nature can take your breath away just by one glance. Nature also allows you to do many different activities such as hiking or snowboard and many different activities. High Ropes are challenge courses that are mostly locatd in the mountains, mostly on camp sites and they are about 40 feet tall. They can be very scary for some people or if you have never done them before, but if you do the high ropes from time to time than you'll get the hang of it.  What You bascically do in these challenge courses is you climb up to a tower and walk on wire strings to get from on course to another by just hanging onto strings to support you.</p>
